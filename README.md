Everything is working well now. H1, H2, H3, and H4 are all done, and there aren’t any issues. H4 makes an extra file called voting_array.pgm, but that was just for checking things and isn’t important. It’s worth noting that the right threshold to see clear lines on the images can change depending on the picture. For example, using 47 for H2 and 200 for H4 works great for one image, but not for all. Choosing the right threshold can really make a difference so while the threshold I choose can yelid good results for one image may discard some lines others.
